    <h4>BackStory</h4>
    <p>Like other Saiyan infants, Vegeta was kept in an incubation chamber during his infancy. He was prided by his father as a potential genius. At some point during Vegeta's childhood, Beerus paid a visit to the planet Vegeta. While being treated to a feast by Vegeta's father, King Vegeta, the Saiyan king made the mistake of giving Beerus only the second most comfortable pillow, while saving the most pleasant for himself. This resulted in retaliation against the Saiyan King by the Hakaishin. Prince Vegeta, who had been present at the time, rushed to save his father, but was ultimately left constricted by Beerus' intimidating aura. In the film's adaptation of this event he was perturbed by his father's mistreatment, though looked away in dismay nonetheless. Watching his father being used as a footstool for Beerus while he continues to feast. Vegeta does nothing in retatiliation and quickly reverted to his toughened demeanor.
